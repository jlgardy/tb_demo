# tb_demo
Files and instructions for an in-class demo of TB genomic epidemiology

1. This demo requires that you have certain software tools installed on your computer. Before attempting the tutorial, ensure that these tools are installed and functioning!
    a. BWA (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/index.shtml)
    b. samtools (http://www.htslib.org)
    c. bcftools (http://www.htslib.org)
    d. bedtools (http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    e. Mykrobe TB (not Mykrobe MRSA!) (http://www.mykrobe.com/products/predictor/#tb)
    
2. You will also need to download the data files we'll be using. You'll need a reference genome (M. tuberculosis H37Rv, NC000962.3) and the paired-end seuqencing data from our three patients: patient_1, patient_2, and patient_3. These can found in this repo.

3. Make a directory called tb_demo and place your downloaded reference genome and sequencing data there.
